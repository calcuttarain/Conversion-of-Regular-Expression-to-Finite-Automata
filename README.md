# Conversion of Regular Expression to Finite Automata

This project focuses on implementing an algorithm to convert a regular expression into a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) in Python.

## Project Overview:

Regular expressions are powerful tools for pattern matching and text processing. However, they can be challenging to implement efficiently. This project aims to address this challenge by providing a Python implementation of an algorithm that converts regular expressions into equivalent DFAs.

## How to Use:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project folder in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.
3. Run the Python script `conversion_rex_fa.py`.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input a regular expression.

Feel free to explore and modify the Python code to suit your needs or experiment with different regular expressions.

## Dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- No additional libraries or packages required.
